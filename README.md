# Amarelator

A simple Web Love Calculator project, built for the fun of it, made to look slightly serious than it really is

## Features!

- It includes 3 different frameworks

```
Simplex
```

```
Gravis
```

```
  Flames
```

The 3 frameworks operate on 3 different algorithms

### Simplex

it uses a simple love calculator algorithm that guarantees a high score regardless of the matching of the names

### Gravis

There is no guarantee of a great score here, the algorithm runs it course and could be slightly very harsh with its response, no hard feelings though.

### Flames

This works using the popular flames game

There should be some advanced version of this project coming soon, watch this space, at the moment find the project in action here [Amarelator](http://sandbox.desdistrict.com/amarelator/)
